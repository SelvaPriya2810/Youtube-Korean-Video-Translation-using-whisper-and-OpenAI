It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

            "Korean Text:  어쨌든 우리 현우 그만 만나면 안 될까? 난 백현우 씨랑 못 태워져요. 그런 줄 아세요? 행연 씨 이기적이다. 지금 우리 현우랑 선보겠다고 줄선 여자들이요. 복무원에 배기업 정지검만 이렇다고요. 야속하지만 이게 현실이야. 문화! 어? 어? 뭐 하는 거야 지금. 홍연 씨한테 뭐라 그랬어? 아 뭘 뭐라 그래 난. 아 진짜. 아 제라랑도 그만 보냈지. 드라마에서 저런 그렇게 많은 액수가 아니야 약속해. 야 나는 더 정들리 전에 헤어지라는 거야. 그리고 막말로 너 이런 술 안 좋아잖아. 이거 놔봐요. 네. 백현우 씨는 어떤 스타일 좋아하는데요? 완전 청순가량. 이렇게만 안 세고 열이 열이하고 이 슬같은 여자. 얘 그런 스타일 좋아한다고 고등학교 때부터 떠들고 다녔다고요. 그런 거였어 백현우 씨? 그래요. 나 그런 스타일 좋아했어요. 그런데 지금 사랑하는 사람은 홍연 씨 하나야. 그러니까 여기서 우리 누나한테 헛소리 듣고 있지 말고. 그런가요?ит ран서. 저 새끼적으로 못 하시죠?\n"

            "Translated Text: Can we please stop meeting with Hyunwoo? I really can't stand Baek Hyun-woo. Did you know that? Ms. Haengyeon, you’re being selfish. Right now, there are ladies lining up to be introduced to our Hyunwoo. Like those at the service center and big enterprises enforcing stop-work orders—it’s just like that. It’s harsh but that’s the reality. Culture! Huh? What? What are you doing now? What did you say to Ms. Hongyeon? Oh, what are you talking about? Oh, seriously. Oh, we've also stopped seeing Jera. It’s not like the drama, there’s not that much money involved, I promise. Hey, I'm saying break up before you get more attached. And frankly, you don’t even like this kind of alcohol. Let's put this down. Yes. What kind of style does Mr. Baek Hyun-woo like? Absolutely pure and innocent type. Only if it isn’t overly done, a cool and collected woman. He’s been bragging about liking that style since high school. Was that so, Mr. Baek Hyun-woo? Yes, I used to like that style. But now, I only love Ms. Hongyeon. So, stop listening to nonsense from our sister here. Is that so? I see, you really can’t do it then.\n"
